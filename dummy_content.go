		{"ComputerScience", "What is the difference between a compiler and an interpreter?", "A compiler translates the entire program into machine code before execution, whereas an interpreter translates code line-by-line during execution."},
		{"ComputerScience", "What is an algorithm?", "A step-by-step procedure for solving a problem or accomplishing a task, especially by a computer."},
		{"ComputerScience", "What is the purpose of a constructor in object-oriented programming?", "To initialize the object's state or perform any necessary setup when the object is created."},
		{"ComputerScience", "What is the difference between TCP and UDP?", "TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) provides reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of data, while UDP (User Datagram Protocol) is a connectionless protocol that does not guarantee delivery and does not ensure the order of data."},
		{"ComputerScience", "What is recursion?", "Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself in order to solve smaller instances of the same problem."},
		{"ComputerScience", "What is the difference between a stack and a queue?", "A stack is a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) data structure, while a queue is a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) data structure."},
		{"ComputerScience", "What is Big O notation?", "Big O notation is used to describe the upper bound of the time or space complexity of an algorithm in terms of the input size."},
		{"ComputerScience", "What is the purpose of a linked list?", "A linked list is a data structure used for storing a collection of elements where each element points to the next element in the sequence, allowing for efficient insertion and deletion operations."},
		{"ComputerScience", "What is the difference between HTTP and HTTPS?", "HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) is a secure version of HTTP that encrypts data sent between the client and server, providing a higher level of security."},
